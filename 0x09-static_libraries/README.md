In C programming, a static library is a collection of object files that are combined into a single file. This file can then be linked with other object files to create an executable program.

A static library is often referred to as a ".a" file, as this is the typical file extension used for such libraries on Unix-like systems. Static libraries are created using the "ar" (archive) utility, which combines the object files into a single file and adds some metadata to facilitate linking.
